				<span class="image main"><img src="images/rhine-fam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Haven't YOU always wanted to have family in the auto body business? Someone who you could trust, no
					matter what - a person who would give you exceptional service along with a guarantee of
					satisfaction? Well now you do.</p>

				<p>Rhinelander Auto Body is a family run business and has been operating in that fashion for
					generations. YOU are Family at Rhinelander Auto Body.</p>

				<p>Rewind: The Restaino family had the vision to start an auto collision specialty business in 1938. It
					was nearly a decade after the cataclysmic Stock Market crash of 1929, Americans were beginning to
					recover from its dismal effects and the economy was finally on a consistent upswing. Two brothers,
					Pasquale and Nicholas recognized the pattern of growth and stability, and saw the potential for a
					new business market.</p>

				<p>Automobiles were no longer a luxury item; they were becoming ingrained in the fabric of society.
					Every household would soon be the proud owner of a shiny new car and inevitably they would need
					somewhere to go in the unfortunate occurrence of their vehicle being involved in a fender-bender.
					Seeing so many cars swarming the city's streets, Pasquale and Nicholas moved swiftly and bought a
					piece of property on Rhinelander Avenue in the mid-1940s, where they built and opened Rhinelander
					Auto Body.</p>

				<p>Driver licensing tests, and road rules and regulations were nowhere near what they are today;
					consequently people were bumping into each other at an alarming rate. Dings and dents, side-swipes
					and T-bones -- the ways to wreck a car were growing faster than the auto industry could pump new
					brands off of the assembly lines. The owners of Studebakers, Buicks, Packards, and Chryslers were
					lining up to have their modern modes of transport brought back to showroom condition. Business at
					Rhinelander was booming.</p>

				<p>As the years passed and the list of satisfied customers grew Pasquale and Nick were pleased with
					their accomplishments. So they taught their sons the skill sets they would need to one day take over
					the family business. Raymond (Nicholas's son) and Pat (son of Pasquale) worked tirelessly to learn,
					not only, the craftsmanship of being artisans of all aspects the auto body repair business but they
					were taught how to be respected businessmen. This started with dealing with the customer as if he or
					she was family.</p>

				<p>Fast-forward: The boys grew into men as the business evolved into a local institution, and in the
					late 1970s Pasquale and Nicholas handed the reigns over to their sons, knowing full well that they
					would make them proud, and carry on Rhinelander's tradition of unparalleled customer satisfaction
					and the highest standard of auto body repair work available.</p>

				<p>Pat and Raymond took seriously their legacy. They spent years honing the art of auto body repair,
					combining the traditional methods their fathers had taught them with the state-of-the-art
					technological advancements that were blitzing the market.</p>

				<p>First cousins Pat and Ray Restaino incorporated Rhinelander Auto Body in 1982. They strove to ensure
					each customer's needs would be met to the utmost degree. Not only are each of the mechanics, auto
					body and paint artisans, and detailers accustomed to working at their peak performance level, but
					their customer service representatives are groomed in the same meticulous process. "Treat each
					client as if he was your father or brother, or she was your mother or sister; be respectful and
					polite, smile, and make sure every customer is satisfied."</p>

				<p>Decades ago, Pasquale and Nicholas Restaino had a dream, to deliver the highest quality service and
					customer satisfaction available in the auto body business. Their sons worked as a team to keep that
					dream alive. Pat is since the only member of the original Restaino family who still works day in and
					day out from the same facility, which his father had labored, keeping this landmark and its
					reputation alive. Newer measuring equipment has long since replaced rulers, but the same
					old-fashioned customer service principles hold true, as well as the exemplary attention to detail
					you'd expect only from someone who is family to give you.</p>

				<p>Pat is held to a higher standard - his father's, his uncle's, and cousin's. Put your trust in his
					lifelong dedication to a set of values that seem to have become a thing of the past. He and his
					devoted team look forward to the pleasure of providing you with the best possible service available
					and the utmost in customer satisfaction.</p>
